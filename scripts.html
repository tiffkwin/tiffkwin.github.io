I am a resident of [CITY, STATE], and I love my community. I am emailing about the recent crime of police brutality against peaceful protestors in Raleigh.%0D%0A%0D%0AI understand that police officers administered violent crowd-control weaponry against protestors without provocation, including tear gas, rubber bullets, and mace even while children and teens were present. This is a violation of human rights and civil liberty, and I am infuriated that our state-employed police force have so blatantly violated their own laws and hurt my community.%0D%0A%0D%0AI understand that as a representative of the City of Raleigh and the people of North Carolina, your work is dedicated to serving and benefitting the communities where everyday people like me live. I urge you as an individual and your organization as a whole to use your station to do good. Investigate the police divisions who deployed such violent tactics, fire and charge all officers on the ground and the commanding officers with assault, and take concrete steps to demilitarize and defund the police force. Do not call in the national guard to brutalize your own people.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn addition, I demand that we start providing more support towards community efforts and organizations outside of the police forces in order to prevent police brutality and violence in the future. These are of course unprecedented times with the pandemic, when our communities are already suffering so much, especially Black communities who are disproportionately affected by COVID and still being targeted by police. As such, we are completely within our constitutional rights to speak up on behalf of ourselves when our public services fail us, including in protest. And you have failed us. Right now, it is more important than ever to prioritize the health and wellness of the public. How will you act in order do this?%0D%0A%0D%0ASincerely,%0D%0A[YOUR NAME]', '_self');
