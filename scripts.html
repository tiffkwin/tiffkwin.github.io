I am a resident of [CITY, STATE], and I love my community. I am emailing about the recent crime of police brutality against peaceful protestors in Raleigh.%0D%0A%0D%0AOn Saturday, May 30, the Raleigh Police Department fired teargas around 6:30pm into a crowd of demonstrators demanding justice. This crowd included children and elderly folks. Since, you have lied about who inflicted violence during the protest and when, claiming it only happened late in the night. RPD inflicted and instigated the violence with the sun still in the sky, and continues to do so as the protests carry on. This is a violation of human rights and civil liberty, and I am infuriated that our state-employed police force have so blatantly violated their own laws and hurt my community.%0D%0A%0D%0AThat same day, multiple accounts of white supremacist vandalism against LGBTQ+ spaces and symbols were documented. Police scanners picked up officer welcoming right-wing "counter protestors" showing up to protect them and approving the use of expired teargas. Your refusal to name the true violence of policing and white supremacy leaves you complicit in this violence.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn addition, the implementation of a curfew does nothing but suppress the voices of the community and empower the violence of the police. To act as the sole authority of when this curfew will be lifted is dangerous and immoral.%0D%0A%0D%0AI understand that as a representative of the City of Raleigh and the people of North Carolina, your work is dedicated to serving and benefitting the communities where everyday people like me live. I urge you as an individual and your organization as a whole to use your station to do good. Investigate the police divisions who deployed such violent tactics, fire and charge all officers on the ground and the commanding officers with assault, and take concrete steps to demilitarize and defund the police force. Do not call in the national guard to brutalize your own people.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn addition, I demand that we start providing more support towards community efforts and organizations outside of the police forces in order to prevent police brutality and violence in the future. These are of course unprecedented times with the pandemic, when our communities are already suffering so much, especially Black communities who are disproportionately affected by COVID and still being targeted by police. As such, we are completely within our constitutional rights to speak up on behalf of ourselves when our public services fail us, including in protest. It is clear that you have failed us. Right now, it is more important than ever to prioritize the health and wellness of the public. How will you act in order do this?%0D%0A%0D%0ASincerely,%0D%0A[YOUR NAME]', '_self');
